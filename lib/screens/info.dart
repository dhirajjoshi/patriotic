This is the site where the heart of Goddess Sati fell after her body disintegrated into 51 sacred pieces post the Tandav dance of Shiva. The original Danta temple was worshipped by devotees till the King Danta fervently requested the Goddess to reside in Danta. The Goddess granted his request with one condition that the king should not look back even one time till he reached the temple of Danta. In case he failed to do so the Goddess would not shift. The king accordingly led the Goddess down the ill towards the site of Danta. The anklets of the Goddess tinkled and seemed to signal her movements behind the king. However, the king could not resist his curiosity and peeped back for a small look. The Goddess (true to her word) refused to budge even a n inch and the disappointed king had to go away. The place where the Goddess stopped her sojourn was the site of Ambaji temple. Some pilgrims consider their visit incomplete till they have visited both Ambaji temples.'),
